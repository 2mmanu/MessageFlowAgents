In this folder, there are several scripts for Kafka and Redis. These scripts are designed to activate Kafka and Redis through a `quickstart.sh` script. These tools are useful for both development and simulation purposes. By leveraging these scripts, developers can quickly set up a Kafka environment, which is essential for managing real-time data streams. Additionally, the Redis functionality ensures that data is efficiently cached. Utilizing these scripts provides a reliable setup for testing and simulating various scenarios.
